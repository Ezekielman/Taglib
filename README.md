Taglib is, as the name already said, a tags library.

It currently adds 237 new blocks, entity, and item tags for you to use.
With this library, you're prepared for everything you possibly wanna do in your data packs.

I always add new tags to hopefully make it the biggest and best tags library to ever exist
and to eventually cover everything you could potentially need.

If you consider using this library in your data pack please mention this pack.
